# [NOT MAINTAINED] please take over

#Phoreman a foreman clone in PHP

Please excuse my utter ignorance of PHP and total lack of tests for the origin see :

https://github.com/ddollar/foreman

install with

```composer global require oripekelman/phoreman dev-master```

Given a Procfile run

```phoreman start``` in the same directory

Most command line options do not work for the moment.
